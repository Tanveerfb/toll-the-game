# Status — 2026-07-11

Living snapshot. History of the resurrection audit is in git (`docs/STATUS.md` @ `c3040f7`).

## Working (implemented, tested, browser-verified)

- **Battle engine** — full phase state machine, 3-actions-per-turn enemy AI (random living field enemy each action, decisions from live state), win/loss detection.
- **Rank system** — card rank drives damage multiplier, `*Ranked` mechanic values, and `aoeRanked` activation; flat mechanic values stay flat; ultimates rank-immune.
- **Deck (7DS GC rules)** — hand never resets; pure-random one-at-a-time refill with auto-merge on adjacent identical cards (+1 ult gauge per merge); ult guaranteed only if gauge was full BEFORE the refill; deck locked outside `PlayerAction`; empty-hand auto-pass.
- **Sub units** — battle format 4v4 (all field) or 3v3 (4th member auto-sub); sub passive active from bench, no cards, untargetable; promoted at new-turn start after a teammate dies; lone subs auto-convert to field.
- **Character kits** — 16 JSON kits incl. Duke's full Flowing Ruin, Seras (Shock/CRITICAL/Charged), the 7DS collab trio: Meliodas (Deathblow crit ramp, Full Counter stance, stance/buff-cancelling ult), Ban (Lifesteal, Extort stat-steal, Extort Life max-HP shred), Diane (Rupture, rank-gated Attack Seal, Giant's Will ATK ramp), and the HxH collab trio: Gon (buff-before-hit Rock, self ult-gauge fill, Rookie Hunter stat flip), Killua (stance-cancel + rank-gated stun, Detonate), Leorio (rank-scaling team buff, Pierce + Bleed, Kind Hearted Friend character synergy). Tanveer's roster-wide stat rebalance (2026-07-11) is live.
- **Literal durations (ruling #21)** — buffs tick at owner turn start, debuffs/DoT/stun at victim turn end; N turns = N procs / N blocked turns.
- **Type advantage** — Dark<>Light mutual, Red>Green>Blue>Red; +20%/−10%/0; CRITICAL ignores it.
- **Evade system** — base 0% for everyone; Charged stacks grant +5% each; evaded attacks deal nothing but still feed Charged.
- **Crit system** — base 0%; a proc applies the CRITICAL package. **Effective stats** — percent/flat buff-debuff entries now actually change dealt/received damage (`lib/game/stats.ts`); previously they were cosmetic.
- **UI (shadcn/ui + Tailwind 4)** — main menu, team select (format toggle, 1–4 units, art slots), battle arena (compact unit cards, sub badges, victory/defeat overlay with rematch), deck dock with hover previews and rank-aware descriptions, archive tile grid + Dokkan-style detail pages, login/profile (Firebase optional → guest mode).
- **Character art** — full roster AI-generated (ComfyUI + Animagine XL 4.0, Dokkan × 7DSGC style); pipeline in `docs/ART_PIPELINE.md`.
- **Archive UX** — colored effect pills on keyword hover (red attack fx / purple debuffs / green heals+buffs / yellow stances / white cancels), skill chips colored by type, mechanic-driven damage preview scenarios for all kits (incl. per-counter damage rows for counter stances), sticky topnav on every page.
- **Dokkan wording (rulings #26–28)** — descriptions drop numbers ("raises" <50%, "greatly" 50–79%, "massively" 80%+; same for lowers); pills span the stat ("Raises ATK") and hover shows that skill's exact percentages per rank. One pill per unique effect — cancel effects are phrase-level keys. No "own"; cancellable/stackable is the unmentioned default. Permanent stat changes are explicit ("Permanently raises ATK" — its own pill tier); semicolons separate description clauses, applied roster-wide.
- **Single-ally targeting** — single-target ally buffs/heals (Leorio's rank-1 Member of the Zodiac) require marking an ally on the arena (emerald Target badge); rank-gated aoe needs no selection.
- **Pierce** — flat 50% DEF ignore for every card; per-card pierce values removed.
- **Lethal survival (ruling #29)** — Nine Lives catches direct hits AND lethal DoT procs (`lib/game/lethal.ts`, shared by combat + ticks); any revival strips all buffs and debuffs, uncancellable included.
- **Battle QoL** — 1×/2× speed toggle (scales phase auto-advance + enemy resolve delays), battle-log filter (Actions only / All events incl. DoT ticks + passive procs), hover tooltips on unit ▲/▼ effect counters.
- **Kit validation** — Zod schema (`lib/game/characterSchema.ts`) parses every character JSON at load; malformed kits fail with the character id and field named. `npm run check` = tsc + eslint + vitest.
- **Effects vs buffs/debuffs (ruling #30)** — uncancellable entries (synergy bonuses, ramps) are grey "effects": excluded from Rupture/Amplify/Weakpoint counting, cleanse, AI cleanse decisions, and the ▲/▼ counters (grey ◆ counter + "Effects" section instead). Their stat modifiers still apply.
- **Taunt-stance link (ruling #31)** — cancelling a unit's stances/buffs also breaks the taunts it authored; Yalina's Attention Drawer is a real stance now.
- **Extort links (ruling #32)** — the thief's Extort buff dies when no living enemy carries a linked Extort debuff (death/cleanse/expiry); synced after every action and debuff tick.
- **Deck QoL (ruling #33)** — Reset Hand rewinds queue + selection merges + merge-granted gauge to turn start; leftover cards auto-merge when queuing/unqueuing exposes identical neighbors.
- **Momentum gating (ruling #34)** — Yalina gains a stack from every card her team plays incl. her own, only while fielded and alive; benched/dead Yalina gains nothing.
- **Damage-modifier stats (ruling #36)** — `damageDealt` and `damageReduction` are consumed by the damage engine, multiplicative stacking (attacker's damageDealt raises, target's damageReduction shrinks, counters included). Mustafa's Fortress and Yalina's Attention Drawer actually reduce damage now; Sara's [Female] synergy actually raises it.
- **Extort overwrite (ruling #38)** — recasting Extort strips the thief's previous Extort debuffs from all enemies before applying; victim debuffs never stack.
- **Synergy display** — tag synergies render as `[Tag] Synergy` (typed buff, never "amplify"); per-carrier scaling confirmed as designed (ruling #35).
- **Enemy action count (ruling #39)** — 1 action per living field enemy, max 3, instead of a flat 3.
- **Battle log dump** — SAVE BATTLE LOG on the victory/defeat overlay writes teams + the full event log to `<project>/battle-log/` via `app/api/battle-log` (gitignored, playtest debugging).
- **Tests** — 134 across combat rank, Flowing Ruin, AI, debuff skills, damage formula, ticks, subs, deck flow, Seras, 7DS kits, HxH kits, description placeholders, ally targeting, lethal survival, effects/links, playtest-2 regressions.

## Open Issues

| # | Issue | Where | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | Ultimates have no rank while skills rank up — confirmed intended for now; Tanveer may add an ult level-up system later | `types/ultimateCard.ts` | Design note |
| 7 | `Character.passive: any` and `as any` casts around mechanics — type safety hole | `types/character.ts` | Medium (refactor) |
| 13 | Art nitpicks: Seras's horn-like hair tufts didn't render; Yalina's side braid renders as loose side curls (trigger-word/style limits — see ART_PIPELINE trigger-word table) | `public/characters/` | Cosmetic (re-roll) |
| 14 | Design feedback 2026-07-11: Mustafa approved; Siddiq redesigned (v2, still AI-invented — awaiting his sheet); Batra reworked per his direction (turban/beard/kesari, no armour). He loves Lyra/Sara/Gabrist; Duke/Yalina/Seras fine for now, iterate later | `docs/ART_PIPELINE.md` | Pending input |
| 16 | Rank-gated effect text shows literal zeros at rank 1 (e.g. "stuns for 0 turn(s) at rank 2+", Diane's "0 turn Attack Seal") — cosmetic; consider hiding zero-value sentences in the translator | `descriptionTranslator.ts` | Cosmetic |
| 15 | Console `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions` — the Firestore `users/{uid}` read fires when signed in but rules deny it. Client now degrades gracefully (single warn, plays on with local state); `firestore.rules` written in repo root (own-doc read/write) — **needs deploying to the Firebase project** | Firebase / `firestore.rules` | Low |
| 20 | Battle screen page gets a user-friendliness overhaul in a future batch (Tanveer, 2026-07-11) — after all mechanics work as expected. Include: lethal mid-queue skips the remaining damage animations and jumps straight to the win screen (playtest 2, match 2) | `components/game/*` | Planned |
| 21 | Enemy AI decision quality (target/skill choices) needs tweaking — future batch per Tanveer (playtest 2) | `lib/game/ai.ts` | Planned |

Closed this batch: #17 ("Permanently" = cancel-proof, ruling #37), #19 (damage-modifier stats wired, ruling #36).

## Not Built Yet

- Story mode (menu button disabled) — needs Tanveer's enemy kits + stage design
- Player progression/collection (playerStore is a stub; profile shows account only)
- ~10 additional characters (Tanveer adds when game is in working order)
- Mobile layout pass, sound
- Deployment (Vercel target; Firebase project `toll-the-game` exists for auth/Firestore)

## Environment

- Node 24, Next.js 16.2.10, React 19.2.7. Majors deliberately held: TypeScript 5.9 (not 6), ESLint 9 (not 10) — Next 16 support unconfirmed.
- Known `npm audit` leftover: postcss <8.5.10 nested inside `next` — upstream.
- Firebase env in `.env.local` (gitignored); pullable via Firebase MCP from project `toll-the-game`. App runs guest-mode without it.
- ComfyUI portable @ `E:\Installed\ComfyUI_windows_portable` for art generation.
